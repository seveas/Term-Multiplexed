Term::Multiplexed - Detect terminal multiplexers (screen, tmux)

SYNOPSIS

  use Term::Multiplexed qw(multiplexed attached multiplexer);
  if(multiplexed) {
      say "Using " . multiplexer . " as terminal multiplexer";
      say "Currently " . (attached ? : "not ") . "attached.";
  }

DESCRIPTION

When running scripts inside screen/tmux, it's often useful to detect this and
to detect whether the multiplexer of choice is currently attached or not. This
module does exactly that and nothing more.

EXPORTS

multiplexed

Returns whether we are running inside a terminal multiplexer or not. Currently
only screen and tmux are detected.

attached

Returns true when the multiplexer is attached. Returns undef when called
outside a multiplexed environment.

detached

outside a multiplexed environment.

multiplexer

The name of the current multiplexer. Currently only "screen" and "tmux" are
possible return values.
